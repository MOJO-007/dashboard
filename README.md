YouTube Comment Automation DashboardThis project provides a web dashboard to authenticate with your Google account, view your YouTube uploaded videos and their comments, and includes a basic framework for automating replies to comments using the YouTube Data API and optionally, the Gemini API for intelligent responses.ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices for Secret KeysNEVER commit your .env file to your Git repository. Your .env file contains sensitive information like GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, and SESSION_SECRET. If these are exposed, your application can be compromised.To prevent this, ensure you have a .gitignore file in your project's root directory:Create .gitignore: If you don't have one, create a file named .gitignore in the same directory as your server.js file.Add .env: Add the following line to your .gitignore file:.env
node_modules/
This tells Git to ignore the .env file and the node_modules directory (which contains all your installed packages).ðŸš€ How to Clone and Run This ProjectFollow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:PrerequisitesNode.js: Make sure you have Node.js (v16.x or higher recommended) and npm installed.

cd <your-repository-name>
Install Dependencies:npm install

Add your Google API credentials and a session secret to this file:GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
SESSION_SECRET=A_VERY_LONG_AND_RANDOM_STRING_FOR_SESSION_SECURITY
# GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE (Only if you're using Gemini outside of Canvas and need a direct API key)
Replace YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE and YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE with your actual credentials from the Google Cloud Console.Generate a strong, unique, random string for SESSION_SECRET.Run the Server:node server.js
